# Progress

## Current State

- Central monitor and owner-strict routing are active for the local
  `agent-usage-collector` project.
- Phase 14 local activation is accepted: a worker payload is durably written
  to a local inbox before acknowledgement and resolves the real task-card path.
- Phase 14 branch-aware monitoring is accepted: the configured worker branch
  for `usage-mvp-01` produced a `review_submitted` orchestrator delivery.
- `phase14-local-03` is accepted: the worker branch was pushed, the monitor
  detected `review_submitted`, 72 focused tests and coordination validation
  passed, and the status-projector delivery is recorded on the task board.

## Active Work

- `phase14.5-summary-01` is ready to record the accepted and integrated
  Phase 14.5 evidence in the project plan.
- `phase14.5-04` is ready but depends on that summary; it is restricted to a
  supervised-launch design and cannot implement or invoke a runtime.

## Blockers And Risks

- The focused branch-aware pytest suite exceeded the bounded local verification
  window; the accepted compatibility runner and real monitor demonstration are
  retained as evidence, with a provisioned full-suite rerun still desirable.
- Same-machine runtime state is Git-ignored by design; cross-machine delivery
  is deferred.
- The status-projector worker branch is accepted but intentionally not yet
  merged into `main`.

## Next Action

Record an evidence-backed phase summary, decide the `phase14-local-03`
integration path, then open the bounded OpenCode runtime-adapter preflight.
